## What is Nerve?

You can already chat with your OpenClaw agent through webchat, Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord. Nerve is what you open when chatting isn't enough.

Nerve is a self-hosted web UI for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) AI agents. Voice conversations, live workspace editing, inline charts, cron scheduling, and full token-level visibility. One install script. Running in 30 seconds.

## Why Nerve?

Messaging channels are great for chatting. But you can't watch charts render in real-time, edit your agent's workspace mid-conversation, browse its files, or monitor token spend from a Telegram window. Nerve is the dashboard that gives you the full picture.

## What makes it different

### Voice that actually works
Talk to your agent in 12 languages. Explicit language selection (no flaky auto-detect), wake-word activation, per-language stop/cancel phrases, and on-device Whisper transcription with model selection (tiny, base, small) plus GPU detection. No API key needed. Multi-provider TTS with Edge, OpenAI, and Replicate.

### Full workspace visibility
Your sub-agent sessions, workspace files, memory, config, tools. All visible, all editable, all live. No file hunting, no guessing what it remembers.

### Live charts from a chat message
Your agent can drop interactive TradingView charts, candlestick plots, and data visualizations directly into the conversation. Say "show me gold this year" and get a real chart, not a code block.

### Cron and scheduling from the UI
Create recurring jobs and one-shot reminders. Every scheduled run shows up as its own session in the sidebar. You can watch it execute live, read the full transcript, and see exactly what it did.

## Everything else

| | |

| **Code actions** | Copy or save-to-file buttons on every code block |
| **API key management** | Add provider keys from settings — writes to .env and hot-reloads, no restart needed |
| **14 themes** | Dark, light, and everything in between. Resizable panels, custom fonts |

## Get Started

### One command

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daggerhashimoto/openclaw-nerve/master/install.sh | bash
```

The installer handles dependencies, cloning, building, and launching. It runs a setup wizard that auto-detects your gateway token and walks you through configuration.

### Manual install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daggerhashimoto/openclaw-nerve.git
cd openclaw-nerve
npm install
npm run setup    # interactive wizard — configures .env
npm run prod     # builds and starts the server
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev            # frontend — Vite HMR on :3080
npm run dev:server     # backend — watch mode on :3081
```

**Requires:** Node.js 22+ and an [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) gateway.

## How it works

```
Browser ─── Nerve (:3080) ─── OpenClaw Gateway (:18789)
  │            │
  ├─ WS ──────┤  proxied to gateway
  ├─ SSE ─────┤  file watchers, real-time sync
  └─ REST ────┘  files, memories, TTS, models
```

Nerve proxies WebSocket traffic to your gateway and adds its own REST layer.

**Frontend:** React 19 · Tailwind CSS 4 · shadcn/ui · Vite 7
**Backend:** Hono 4 on Node.js

## Security

Nerve binds to `localhost` by default — only you can access it. When you expose it to the network (`HOST=0.0.0.0`), built-in password authentication protects all endpoints. The setup wizard auto-prompts for a password when network access is configured.

- **Session cookies** — `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`, HMAC-SHA256 signed
- **Password storage** — scrypt with 32-byte salt
- **WebSocket auth** — cookie verified on upgrade
- **Gateway token fallback** — works as a password with zero config

See [Security](docs/SECURITY.md) for the full threat model.
